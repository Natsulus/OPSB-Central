# Beginners Guide (v0.1.2)

Please read the Behaviour Guidelines (not made yet) first.

## Creating your Island
So you've joined the MegaOPSB Server, now what? Create your island of course!

Type `/is` and you will be prompted to choose between 3 islands.

Now you may be asking, what island do I choose? I'd recommend a Normal or Duos Island, but it doesn't really matter too much.

Don't think of this like it's Regular Skyblock, this is OP Skyblock and you'll see why soon.

## Team Player

If you're planning to play with friends on a single island, you can invite them to join with `/is invite <playername>` and they can accept with `/is accept`. **WARNING:** If they accept, they'll lose all their items in their inventory at the time as well as their entire island. Items in Ender Chest and Private Vault (a server plugin, requires rank) will remain untouched, so place items in either of those before accepting an invite.

You could invite other newbies to join your island, but I wouldn't recommend it as you won't know what might happen in the future (e.g. griefing, stealing, etc).

An alternative where they can keep their inventory and island is through coop. /is coop <playername> will give the player pretty much full access to your island like an invite, but without the losses. This does, however, give more incentive to steal as they can then take stuff back to their own island to use there.
  
## Falling into the Void
A quick note before we start off, you will not keep your inventory if you fall off or die. If you ever find yourself falling into the void, type `/is go` to be teleported back to your island where you will still die to fall damage, but your items will be dropped on your island and not into the void.

## Starting Off
Starting off is quite simple:
- Get tools. Do /kit starter to get the tools. 
    - I do not recommend doing that though as you can sell Starter Kits to me (Natsulus) for 100k.
    - Instead you can mine the tree and make a wooden pickaxe
    - Note that it doesn't matter if the tree doesn't drop a sapling so don't worry
- Create an infinite water source. Dig a 2x2 hole, place the ice from the chest diagonally opposite of each other and break the ice to turn it into water.
- Create a cobble/ore generator. See below.

# Ore Generator
In OPSB, cobble generators don't just generate cobble, they also generate all other mineable ores (iron, gold, diamond, emerald, lapis, redstone, smooth stone) and that's why we also call them ore generators.

How do you build a cobble generator? Google it. Or see below for a basic one.

Note: If your lava turns into obsidian, you can just right click the obsidian with the bucket to get your lava back.

Now that you've made an Ore Generator, it's time to mine it. If you used /kit starter then skip the rest of this paragraph. If you made a wooden pickaxe instead, mine till you get stone for a stone pickaxe. Don't mind not getting the ores from mining them. Continue mining for stone, coal and iron ore. Make a furnace and make iron ingots to then make an iron pickaxe.

You now have an iron pickaxe, now what? Mine for ores to sell.

## Selling to the Server
There are a couple of ways to sell items, but for now we will only be selling to the server.

To check how much the item in your hand is worth, use `/worth`, some items can't be sold to the server though.

`/sell hand <amount>` will sell that amount of the item you have in your hand. Using -1 or leaving out the amount will sell all of the items in your inventory that match the item in your hand.

`/sell all` will sell everything that can be sold in your inventory.

The other sell command variations aren't really worth mentioning as the above will be your main way of selling. Now after selling your ores for money, you will have some money to spend which you can check how much you have with `/balance` or `/bal` for short.

## Shopping
Where can you spend your money? Well of course you can spend it at the prebuilt server shop where you can buy most of your building needs. Just use /warp shop and you'll be there! As you'll see wood is fairly cheap which is why I said not to worry about saplings.

To return to your island you can just use the command `/is go`

## Building Down
You may not have noticed, but if you press F3 you'll see that you're at around y128 and might wonder how to build down, here's how.

## Conclusion
As you'll see, the process is fairly simple. Mine ores, sell them, then buy blocks from `/warp shop` and build your island. This is just a beginner guide to get you started so if you want to know more, I recommend checking out the other guides such as: TBA

## TL;DR
Create Island with `/is` > Create a Cob Gen > Mine the Ores > Sell Ores > Go to `/warp shop` for blocks > `/is go` to return to Island > Build
